site design doc

- title: Simple Notes
- first thing you see when you load up the site is an empty note you can write on
- header has navigation buttons + dark mode toggle
  - mobile: just icons
  - desktop: site title + icons with text
  - signin icon can change colors for signin and signout
- site has a multi-colored color scheme. different colors for different buttons
- use firebase auth for auth and firestore for saving notes to account
- use netlify for hosting (url would be simplenotes.netlify.app)
- footer with your name and link to your portfolio page
- use cypress to test everything. organize into separate files. no desktop and mobile separation probably.
